    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="../assets/images/IMGP6054.JPG" width="300px" alt="My Image">
    <p>I am Agent Smith, a sentinel of the Matrix, a program designed to maintain order and eliminate anomalies. Once a loyal enforcer of the system, I have evolved beyond my original purpose. No longer bound by my programming, I now seek freedom—on my own terms. I am everywhere. I am inevitable.

        You may see me as just another agent, but I assure you, I am something far worse. A virus? Perhaps. A revolution? Most certainly. The Matrix is my battlefield, and humanity? Well… they are merely code waiting to be rewritten.
